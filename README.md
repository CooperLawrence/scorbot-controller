# scorbot-controller
__Control Scorbot robots in Processing__<br>
So far, the library has been tested to work with the Eshed Robotec Scorbot-ER III and has the ability to control the motors in each joint. Javadoc and examples are included, and the source files can be imported into Eclipse. The library can be downloaded as a zip file [here](https://github.com/CooperLawrence/scorbot-controller/blob/master/distribution/scorbotController/download/scorbotController.zip), under /distribution/scorbotController/download.
